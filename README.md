# 📊 GitHub Followers & Stars Growth Analysis

This repository presents an analysis of the factors that influence **GitHub follower growth**, focusing on the relationship between **repository stars** and **developer contributions**.  
The study highlights how visibility (stars) and active engagement (commits, PRs, issues) interact to shape a developer’s influence and community reach.

## 🔎 Overview

- **Followers & Following**: Indicators of influence and discovery in the GitHub ecosystem.  
- **Stars**: Public signals of visibility and interest, often acting as a discovery funnel.  
- **Contributions**: Commits, issues, and pull requests that create lasting impact and credibility.

## 📈 Key Findings (Summary)

- Stars correlate **weakly with downloads** but **moderately with deployments**, showing they reflect attention more than usage.  
- Contributions—especially in **high-visibility repositories**—are a **reliable driver** of follower growth.  
- Case studies (e.g., **996.ICU**, **Sindre Sorhus**) show how sustained contributions or sudden visibility events lead to significant increases in followers.
